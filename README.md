# CS50-Finance
### This is my implementation of finace (pset 8) from CS50

CS50 Finance is a virtual stock trading web app built in flask. It can log users in and store stock data for each user into a database. It connects with a stock value API (IEX) to enable the user to look up the current price of any stock, and virtually buy and sell them while keeping track of the account balance.

### If you are currently going through this pset, remember CS50's rules on academic honesty:
